        <h2>Fair Trade</h2>
        <p>
            Fair Trade means fair and respectful trade between producers and buyers.
            Farmers and workers receive a fair wage for their work and have safe working conditions. It also supports environmental protection and sustainable farming.
            By buying Fair Trade products, we help people in poorer countries improve their lives and support their families. Fair Trade helps make the world a more just and equal place.

        <h2>Fair to Planet</h2>
        <p>
            Being fair to Planet Earth means treating out environment with care and respect. The Earth provides us with air, water, food, and natural resources, so it is our responsibility to protect it. When we take care of the planet, we are also taking care of ourselves and future generations
            We can be fair to the Earth by reducing waste, recycling, and using fewer single use plastics. Saving energy and water, walking or biking instead of driving, and turning off lights when they are not needed also help reduce pollution. Protecting forests, oceans, and animals is important because all living things are connected

        <h2>Fair to Animals</h2>
        <p>
            Treating animals fairly is important because they have feelings and needs just like humans. Fairness means providing them with food, water, shelter, and love, and making sure they are not hurt or mistreated. Every animal deserves respect, whether it is a pet at home, a farm animal, or wildlife in nature.
            Being fair to animals also means thinking about their natural habitats and avoiding actions that could harm them. Simple actions like not abandoning pets, not supporting cruelty in entertainment, and protecting endangered species help animals live better lives. Teaching others about kindness to animals creates a world where all living creatures are treated with care and compassion.

        <h2>Racial Fairness</h2>
        <p>
            Racial fairness means treating everyone equally, no matter the color of their skin or where they come from.
            Racial fairness is about respecting all people, valuing differences, and making sure everyone has the same opportunities. It means we do not judge or treat someone unfairly because of their race or ethnicity. Everyone deserves to be heard, included, and treated with kindness.
            By practicing racial fairness, we can create communities where everyone feels safe and valued. Simple actions like listening to others, standing up against unfair treatment, and celebrating diversity help build a fairer world.
            Even small acts of fairness and respect can make a big difference in making our schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods welcoming for everyone.
