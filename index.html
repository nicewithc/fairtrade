                <p class="##">
                Treating animals fairly is important because they have feelings and needs just like humans. Fairness means providing them with food, water, shelter, and love, and making sure they are not hurt or mistreated. Every animal deserves respect, whether it is a pet at home, a farm animal, or wildlife in nature.
                Being fair to animals also means thinking about their natural habitats and avoiding actions that could harm them. Simple actions like not abandoning pets, not supporting cruelty in entertainment, and protecting endangered species help animals live better lives. Teaching others about kindness to animals creates a world where all living creatures are treated with care and compassion.

                <h1>Racial Fairness</h1>                <p>
                Racial fairness means treating everyone equally, no matter the color of their skin or where they come from.
                Racial fairness is about respecting all people, valuing differences, and making sure everyone has the same opportunities. It means we do not judge or treat someone unfairly because of their race or ethnicity. Everyone deserves to be heard, included, and treated with kindness.
                By practicing racial fairness, we can create communities where everyone feels safe and valued. Simple actions like listening to others, standing up against unfair treatment, and celebrating diversity help build a fairer world.
                Even small acts of fairness and respect can make a big difference in making our schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods welcoming for everyone.

                    Secondly, there are lots of accidents every year because 
                    there are so many cars.

                <p>
                    So what can we do? There should be more buses and trains 
                    in big cities and more bicycle tracks.
